# Chance logics

## Communicative role

Events can play out in unexpected ("random") ways.

## Abstract process

Sampling from stationary or nonstationary event sources, along with analysis of probabilities, expected values, etc.

## Abstract operations

* Check/alter the likelihood of an event occurring.
* Cause an event to happen (perhaps from a pool of events) with some likelihood.
* Make a random draw from a stationary or nonstationary source

## Presentation

* Show random chances like success rates as textual percentages or discrete certain/likely/unlikely/impossible symbols
* Show expected values as ranges between minimum and maximum possible values
* Highlight extremely unlikely outcomes with visual effects
* For nonstationary sampling as in sampling without replacement (e.g., from a shuffled deck of cards), show the upcoming picks or the remaining size of the bag

## Required concepts

* Types of random events

## Provided concepts

* Chances, for example success rates or expected damage value
