# Temporal pattern matching logics

## Communicative role

Some sequences of events can have different effects when they occur with particular timing or in a particular order.

## Abstract process

Observe sequences of events to recognize when a pattern is matched and trigger an action when this occurs.

## Abstract operations

* Trigger an event when a temporal pattern is matched
* Determine which, if any, temporal patterns are currently under consideration/partially matched
* Determine how well a new event matches any pattern currently under consideration

## Presentation

* Give the player feedback on how well their input lines up with the temporal pattern
* Provide visual or audio feedback when a temporal pattern is satisfied
* Show the sequence of actions under consideration to the player in a textual or pictorial representation

## Required concepts

* Types of events to be matched
* Streams of events

## Provided concepts

* Matched patterns
* Timing quality

## Notes

Music/rhythm games are often based on temporal pattern-matching logics, as are time-sensitive mini-games and special moves in fighting games.
