title: Progression logics 
---

# Communicative role

The content of a game and its behavior can change as the player makes progress through various sequences of goals.

# Abstract process

Track and check measures of progress (potentially on multiple fronts).

# Abstract operations

* Update or reset progression on some front, or track some flag.
* Check whether the player has progressed past some threshold, or whether something should be available.
* Parameterize operations of other logics based on progression.

# Presentation

* Pop up an achievement or other notification (e.g., a title card) when game progress takes place
* Show story events in a logbook or as a network of events
* Write text so that non-player characters refer to earlier stages of progression

# Required concepts

* Types of progress

# Provided concepts

* Current status on progress measures

# Notes

This can be used for things like quests and chains of quests, for in-engine cutscenes and scripted events, and to gate some content based on other content.
