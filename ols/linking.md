# Linking logics

## Communicative role

Some things, in some context, are related or connected to each other.

## Abstract process

Maintain, enumerate, and follow/activate directed connections between concepts.

## Abstract operations

* Determine/alter which links are available potentially according to operators of other logics
* Perform some action when a link is activated or traversed
* Enumerate or perform some action on all the objects linked to another object

## Presentation

* Show a laid-out graph of links between concepts.
* Highlight links which are available to traverse/activate or hide those which are unavailable
* Scroll smoothly when moving between connected spaces, if connections have a "side"
* Play a screen transition when moving between connected spaces

## Required concepts

* Things to be linked together
* Types of links and attributes of those links

## Provided concepts

* Networks of linked objects
* Current "positions" in those networks

## Notes

This can be used for spatial links between rooms, for dialog trees (navigating an abstract space), for character progression systems like Final Fantasy X's Sphere Grid, and for a wide variety of other uses.
