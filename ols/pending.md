* Physics    
* Linking  
* Spatial pattern matching  
* Temporal pattern matching  
* Game mode  
* Character state  
* Control logic WHO acts on/controls WHAT  
* Chance (what is the likelihood/make it happen with this likelihood). Would be great if we could sequester randomness here. Gives a good account for e.g. Initiative in RPG battles or for damage rolls, especially when combined with resource logics!
* (Game progress?) A model built from e.g. NPC dialog switches or town swaps orâ€¦ It may or may not be a logic, and the tricky thing is e.g. side quests that open up at once and have their own progressions and then close off due to main quest progress
