# Spatial pattern matching logics

## Communicative role

Arranging objects in certain ways can cause things to happen.

## Abstract process

Analyze the positions of objects and trigger events when they enter or leave particular layout patterns.

## Abstract operations

* Determine whether a set of objects is arranged in a particular pattern
* Perform some action when a pattern is matched
* "Click" or automatically align objects into a particular arrangement

## Presentation

* Highlight objects which partially or fully satisfy a pattern with visual effects

## Required concepts

* Things to be analyzed for pattern matching
* A space in which those things are laid out

## Provided concepts

* Matched patterns
* Slots in which objects can be arranged

## Notes

In a point-and-click or parser adventure game, we might consider situations like "use HAMMER on ROCK" or "put FISH in OCEAN" as cases of spatial matching.  This also covers puzzle games like Tetris or Bejeweled as well as certain puzzles in RPG dungeons and potentially the minigames you see in e.g. golf games. 

Some crafting systems also use spatial pattern matching logics.
